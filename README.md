<p>At the end of this project I will describe it and write a self reflection on the skills I have demonstrated upon completion. It is written below.<br>This project allowed me to practice inserting photos, creating ordered/unordered lists, headings, internal links, and boilerplate html by making a website with some recipes I enjoy to eat and make. I also practiced using github to save snapshots of my project with clear commit messages. Finally, I continued to solidify my knowledge of the command line.</p>
